# Movie-lover-recommendations
A project to create a website to recommend movies based on letterboxd watchlists and available streaming services, with the end goal of using sentiment analysis on user reviews of movies to find improved movie recommendations and cater to multiple people and different streaming services.

## Rough roadmap
* Start with comparing watchlists for different letterboxd users to find common films using webscraping. (Done)
* Create a basic website to visualise results using movie posters with link to movie page. (Done)
* Include streaming service to find available films from service in watchlist. (In progress)
* Improve processing speeds with TMDB API.
* Webscrape reviews off the top 100 movies in letterboxd, IMDB, rotten tomatoes.
* Use attention mechanisms to identify other films mentioned and sentiment analysis for if it is better/worse than the movie in question.
